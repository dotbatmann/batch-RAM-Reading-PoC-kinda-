# batch-RAM-Reading-PoC-kinda
im just explaining no code sadly

| RAM aimbots are *theoretically* possible with batch.                                  |
| Batch itself cannot read RAM, but with PowerShell or similar tools you technically    |
| can. However, it would not be good enough to be practical.                            |
|                                                                                      |
| Even if you pulled it off, it would likely run very slowly because batch is weak      |
| and not designed for real-time tasks. You could *maybe* get player locations and      |
| store them in variables, but the performance would be terrible.                       |
|                                                                                      |
| Pure batch (even with PowerShell help) also cannot reliably control mouse movement.   |
| Because of this, something like a wallhack might be *possible*, but it would be       |
| inefficient and nowhere near the level of a compiled .exe.                            |

Note:
If this ever gets popular, I might explore a wallhack-style PoC for a game.
Not Roblox — it uses Luau and VM-based systems, which makes batch-based
experiments especially painful.
