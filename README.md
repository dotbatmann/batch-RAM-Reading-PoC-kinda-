# batch-RAM-Reading-PoC-kinda
im just explaining no code sadly 


ok so RAM AimBots are possible with batch kinda batch itself can not read RAM 
but with powershell etc you acutally can but not good enough if you actually
pulled it off it would most likely run slowly because batch is quite weak 
it is possible since you can kinda get player locations you could use variables
too but that would most likely be slow and pure batch even with power shell 
cant change your mouse cords well maybe so you could make wall hacks but they 
wouldnt be efficent like .exe

| Real RAM aimbots rely on:                  |
|                                            |
|  • Fast repeated memory reads              |
|  • Pointer chasing                         |
|  • Matrix math (world → screen)            |
|  • Low-latency mouse input                 |
